My name is Vicenc Fernandez, Associate Professor in Management and Business Analytics in the Department of Management at the [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/ca) · BarcelonaTech (UPC). I'm co-founder of the [TechTalent-Lab](https://techtalent-lab.upc.edu/en), and I'm teaching in several Engineering and Informatics Schools at the UPC.

My research interest cover a broad range of facets of the use of technology in the HR management. Currently, I'm focusing on Workforce Analytics. My teaching covers three topics: Business Analytics, HR Management, and Project Management. 

My core tools for data analysis are R and RStudio.
