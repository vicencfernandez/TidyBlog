My name is Vicenç Fernández Alarcón (NBU: Vicenc Fernandez), and I work as Associate Professor at at the [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya - BarcelonaTech (UPC)](https://www.upc.edu/ca). I am attached to the [Department of Management](https://doe.upc.edu/ca), and I am currently teaching at the [School of Industrial, Aerospace and Audiovisual Engineering (ESEIAAT)](https://eseiaat.upc.edu/ca) and the [Barcelona School of Building Construction (EPSEB)](https://epseb.upc.edu/ca).
 
My research interests cover a broad range of facets of industrial organization: organizational and consumer behavior, air transport management and analysis of transportation networks. I am member of the Advisory Board of [Management Decision](https://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/journal/md), and editor of the [Journal of Airline and Airport Management](https://jairm.org/index.php/jairm).

My teaching covers three topics: air transport and airport operations, optimization problems and business analytics. [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) pervades all my teaching, and my colleagues and I advocate a hands-on, practical approach to learning industrial engineering.
